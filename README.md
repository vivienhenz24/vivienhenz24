# 🎆 Particle Simulation

Welcome to my interactive particle simulation! This project features a dynamic particle system with physics-based movement, gravity, collision detection, and interactive elements.

## ✨ Features

- **Physics-based movement** with gravity and velocity
- **Collision detection** with wall bouncing
- **Interactive particles** - move your mouse to create new particles
- **Dynamic connections** between nearby particles
- **Colorful particles** with random colors and sizes
- **Smooth animations** with fade effects

## 🚀 Try It Out

Open `particles.html` in your browser to see the simulation in action!

### Interactive Controls:
- **Mouse movement**: Creates new particles as you move
- **Click**: Spawns a burst of particles at the click location
- **Automatic**: Particles continuously spawn and interact

## 🛠️ Technical Details

The simulation is built using:
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- JavaScript ES6+ for particle physics
- CSS for styling and layout
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps animation

## 📁 Files

- `particles.html` - The main simulation file
- `README.md` - This documentation

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- Particle attraction/repulsion forces
- Different particle types and behaviors
- Sound effects on particle interactions
- Performance optimizations for larger particle counts
